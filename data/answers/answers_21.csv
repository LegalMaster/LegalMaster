Excerpt: 285 P.3d 860 (2012). Because the City did not charge the public a fee for using the 1-90 trail, the only question is whether genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether the trail was open for recreational purposes. I. A landowner cannot “open” land that is already open to the public and that the landowner lacks authority to close ¶29 The recreational immunity statute applies only to those landowners with “lawful possession and control” over land who “allow members of the public” to use it “for the purposes of outdoor recreation.” RCW 4.24.210(1). A landowner has “lawful possession and control” over land if it holds “continuing authority to determine whether the land should be open to the public.” Tennyson v. Plum Creek Timber Co., 73 Wn. App. 550, 557-58, 872 P.2d 524 (1994) 
Choices: ['0: holding that whether the public invitee may have some commercial purpose in mind was irrelevant to recreational immunity instead by opening up the lands for recreational use without a fee the landowner brought itself under the protection of the immunity statute', '1: holding that the court evaluating a claim of qualified immunity must first determine whether the plaintiff states a claim of a constitutional violation at all and then must determine whether the claimed right was clearly established before proceeding to the qualified immunity question', '2: recognizing that a landowner cancontrol who uses his land for recreational purposes and that sjuch discretion should not result in the forfeiture of the immunity that thehrus provides', '3: holding contractors could not claim recreational immunity because they had no continuing authority to determine whether the land should be open to the public', '4: holding that so long as seattle city light opened up the diablo dam to the public for recreation immunity applied despite a contractual provision compelling it to open land for public recreational purposes']",dY6ZPUfXQRYjmVRrZQZzLd,"How much is a First Edition?

Excerpt: to move for the exclusion of time, it argues that this failure did not contribute to the delay. Instead, the government contends that Koerber caused the delay in January 2011 by requesting (and receiving) an indefinite pretrial-motion-cutoff date. In evaluating the government’s position, we note that we later address how Koerber’s role in the trial delays might affect the STA analysis. But first we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in considering this 42-day period as part of the government’s “pattern of neglect” leading to the STA violation. The January 27, 2011 continuance for pretrial motions did not trigger an excludable delay in the STA clock. See 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(1); Bloate v.

Given the close relationship between an inmate filing a grievance and filing a lawsuit — indeed, the former is generally a prerequisite for the latter — our jurisprudence provided a strong signal that offic have recognized an inmate’s right to be free from retaliation for filing a grievance under the First Amendment (albeit without referencing a particular clause).

Excerpt: courts had held that “absolute immunity was conferred upon judges acting within their lawful powers, even where the actions allegedly involved serious misconduct,” and that this principle “was directly imported into the law of the United States as the common-law basis for judicial immunity.” This common law principle is most often used to immunize a judge from liability in civil litigation, but it has also been used to support the proposition that a judge cannot be compelled to testify about his or her thought process in making a decision in a case. See State v. Lewis, 656 So.2d 1248 (Fla.1994) (stating that a judge may not be examined as to his or her thought process in making a decision); Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles v.

Excerpt: U.S. 490, 498, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975). Thus, in the absence of an injury and with no “real and substantial” dispute, the court properly declined to entertain Count I upon removal. In its Dismissal Opinion, the district court compared this proceeding to the situation in Bowen v. First Family Financial Services, Inc., 233 F.3d 1331 (11th Cir.2000). In Bowen, the class action plaintiffs lacked standing to question whether arbitration agreements are generally unenforceable under the Truth-in-Lending Act. The Eleventh Circuit so ruled because “there [was] no allegation that First Family has invoked, or threatened to invoke, the arbitration agreement to compel the plaintiffs to submit any claim to arbitration.” Id. at 1339.
